<i>São Paulo,</i>

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,166
<i>almost 13 million inhabitants.</i>

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>This part of my story began here.
In autumn.</i>

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,708
<i>Sampa in autumn means</i>

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,333
<i>rush, reality, scurrying, umbrella,
coat and sunscreen,</i>

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,791
<i>altogether.</i>

7
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:28,083
<i>The weather changes.
Life's hectic and you've gotta be ready.</i>

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,625
<i>Look at Paulista Avenue.</i>

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,666
<i>Imagine how many dreams
you can find there.</i>

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>For example, this was
my last day of work at a law office.</i>

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,041
<i>It seemed fancy to say this was a job,</i>

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,458
<i>but it was
a college extracurricular activity.</i>

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,250
<i>I dreamt about being an intern there,</i>

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,541
<i>but there's a crowd vying
for the same spot.</i>

15
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,375
<i>A huge, crazy competition.</i>

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,250
<i>Was I sad? A little,</i>

17
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,666
<i>but not discouraged.</i>

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,833
<i>That's me,</i>

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,041
<i>Anna Júlia.</i>

20
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:11,458
<i>I like justice, working, joy.
Not music.</i>

21
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,125
<i>I don't like music.</i>

22
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,958
<i>I didn't want this for my life.</i>

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>On the other hand, I wanted this!</i>

24
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,708
<i>I want to be exactly like them
when I'm older. It's a lot of power.</i>

25
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,833
<i>This is João Paulo,</i>

26
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,750
<i>- a street musician.</i>
- Hey, dude!

27
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>Jeez, he turned my world upside down...</i>

28
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,333
Come on, guys. Let's help!
Put some money in here!

29
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,791
Let's enjoy some music, get to know art.

30
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,625
The Pedros!

31
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>Oh, no. Here comes another fantasy.</i>

32
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,125
<i>Double coffee to wake up</i>

33
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,833
<i>Focus and faith I will succeed</i>

34
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>It's not long before I graduate</i>

35
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,375
<i>So many things, but we're here</i>

36
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,708
<i>And it's written
That the expert will arrive</i>

37
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>It's true, it worked out
The Black woman will be in charge</i>

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,833
<i>I came to sing</i>

39
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,958
<i>My journey</i>

40
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,833
<i>With magic</i>

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,208
<i>Of being who I am</i>

42
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,416
<i>- I have love in my chest
- I have love in my chest</i>

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,291
<i>- And I do it my way

<i>- So I can dawn

46
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,791
Come on, guys!

47
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,583
Good morning.

48
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,666
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,291
<i>You know you can't be careless</i>

55
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,458
<i>That this big world comes
And shakes who sleeps</i>

56
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,125
<i>No one can beat me</i>

57
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:11,166
<i>It requires a lot of talent
And direction and luck</i>

58
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,291
<i>- I have love in my chest

00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,458
Wait. I don't like music.

71
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,791
An Unforgettable Year AUTUMN

72
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,583
BASED ON THE WORK OF
BABI DEWET

73
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,416
MOM - DON'T ANSWER

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,375
<i>There's this situation too.
I'll explain it soon.</i>

75
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,000
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Rui.

76
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,833
Thank you.

77
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,375
Excuse me.

78
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,333
Hey, sorry.

79
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,791
- Joice?
- Good morning.

80
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,750
Hi!

81
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,166
Whose stuff is this?

82
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,708
Heitor?

83
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,916
Hey...

84
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,791
Can you move your suitcase, so I can sit?

85
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,541
Unfortunately, I don't have
anywhere to put it.

86
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,125
Go find a chair.

87
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,833
Hey, artist!

88
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,375
Can you stop the noise?
I'm trying to watch the game.

89
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,625
Hey, kid.

90
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,833
Here.

91
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,083
Thanks, Mr. Marcílio.

92
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,250
Listen...

93
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,750
I heard the last band here
had concerts and recorded albums.

94
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,375
The Vultures of the Next Day!

95
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,333
They played at Covers Square
and made a music video that went viral.

96
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,250
Hi.

97
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,333
Came to perform?

98
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,583
In order to play here, you need
to get a pass at the end of the line

99
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,541
- with Baby, who is beside Junk.
- The wonderful Junk!

100
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,791
If you want, come back at dawn.
There's no line nor audience.

101
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,208
But you can play.

102
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
I won't even say a word.

103
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
- Come on! Guys, stay!
- I'm leaving, JP.

104
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,375
Where are you going?
Go get coffee and come back.

105
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,833
I'll wait in line. I'll stay here...

106
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,541
CULTURAL TURN FESTIVAL
ONLY ORIGINAL SONGS

107
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,125
This will be a <i>trend.</i>

108
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,833
Hi, Dad. Did something happen?

109
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,583
Yes. I miss you a lot, kiddo!

110
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,208
And I'd like to know if you want a ride.

111
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,541
I'm driving a nice client
near your office.

112
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,958
<i>- We could celebrate, right?</i>
- There's nothing to celebrate.

113
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,000
But you should, Anna Júlia!

114
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,583
Girl, now you'll have more free time.

115
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,916
Dindinha, tell her.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,083
<i>- Hey, girl! How are you?</i>
- Hi!

117
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,958
<i>Your father told me everything.</i>

118
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,666
Enjoy those young years, girl!

119
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,458
Only you would make me talk
to a passenger.

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,083
- Are you driving? It's dangerous.
<i>- No, baby.</i>

121
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,291
We're stuck in a traffic jam.

122
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,875
I just called
to see if everything is okay.

123
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,416
It will be, Dad.

124
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,500
Since you work nearby,
come by my house later.

125
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,791
<i>- It's in More Than One Squat.</i>
- Thanks. I'll be there.

126
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,958
- Bye, beautiful girl.
- Bye, honey!

127
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,666
- Take care of him.
<i>- Love you.</i>

128
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,625
Bye, guys!

129
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,833
MESSING AROUND
IN THE OFFICE

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,666
Go mess around at home, bye.

131
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,916
Attention, everyone.
I've got news for you.

132
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,583
Well...

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
We lost an intern.

134
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,291
So, I decided to expand
the internship program

135
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,750
to hire one of you to replace him.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,458
This means that this is not the last day
for any of you.

137
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,333
And for those who want
to start a career at this firm,

138
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,666
the good news is...

139
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,208
you have more time to impress me.

140
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,875
- Joice?
- Yes?

141
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,791
- Grab me a cappuccino, please.
- Sure.

142
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,333
No, allow me!

143
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,250
You changed the Wi-Fi password?

144
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,625
What?

145
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,458
Mr. Zé Carlos, I'm a customer today.
It's a cappuccino.

146
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,125
Fancy stuff. Tell me the password.

147
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,958
WI-FI PASSWORD
BUY A CAKE

148
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,250
Empathy! I like you.

149
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,250
Excuse me. Is this the line?

150
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,541
<i>Oh, my God! He's so hot.</i>

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,166
<i>Why did I need just one cappuccino?</i>

152
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,500
Is this a cappuccino?

153
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,458
- Yes, it is.
- Would you sell it to me?

154
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,625
I'll give you the money,
and you give me the goods.

155
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,583
Nice to meet you.
My name is João Paulo. You are?

156
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,416
Thanks.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,166
We did business,
and you didn't tell me your name.

158
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,833
Hey, don't forget it, okay? João Paulo!

159
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,916
In honor of the two Beatles.

160
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,166
- Are you in line?
- No.

161
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,875
DESTINY MAKES YOUR PATH RHYME
WITH MINE

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,666
IT'S LIKE EMICIDA'S VERSE,
WHEN YOU SEE IT, IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

163
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,166
You're fast.

164
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,083
So, pick me.
This internship is all I ever wanted.

165
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,958
- I know.
- I won't let you down.

166
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,208
You must work hard, Anna. Things here
are not easy. You saw the competition.

167
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,583
You must pay attention to everything.

168
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,375
Especially to the details.

169
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,750
Be careful! If you break it,
you need to give me another one.

170
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,208
The stairs! Watch your step.

171
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,250
Hey! Stop it! Excuse me. It won't pass.

172
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,333
- For God's sake.
- Stop complaining.

173
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,291
Excuse me, man!

174
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,916
- Watch the stairs!
- What's going on?

175
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,625
What's this?

176
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,500
Watch the door.

177
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,916
Are we moving and no one told me?

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,333
The band is over, right?

179
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,125
We're moving back to Jaú.

180
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,583
The band is over?
What do you mean, Pedro Jorge?

181
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,500
Excuse me.

182
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,416
- Who decided that?
- I did, right?

183
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,291
We talked about the festival.
It's our chance.

184
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,916
The festival only accepts original songs.
We have none.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,041
But we are good!

186
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,541
We are good,
but have we written anything yet?

187
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,375
- No.
- Right.

188
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,708
- How will we win the festival?
- Relax.

189
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,583
Calm down, <i>brothers.</i>
Isn't that what we are? <i>Brothers!</i>

190
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,791
The Pedros Plus One.

191
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,375
I'm not Pedro!

192
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
But you are my brothers, man.

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Stay!

194
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,166
There's cheese in the fridge.

195
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,458
Is it the mess?

196
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,583
- No.
- I know.

197
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,458
This has nothing to do
with this mess or with you.

198
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,541
- We are the problem.
- Guys.

199
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,541
My mom is in a hurry. Bye, JP!

200
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,958
See you!

201
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,250
The dream is over.

202
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,833
Go ahead!

203
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,583
I'll stay here.

204
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll stay and write a song.

205
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:10,916
You'll see!

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,458
I'm gonna prove to you that one João Paulo

207
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,958
is much more powerful
than three Pedros together!

208
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,708
One!

209
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,791
"THE PEDROS PLUS ONE"
THE BEST COVER BAND IN JAÚ

210
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,166
<i>That day felt like my dream was starting
to become a reality.</i>

211
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,041
<i>As if it was the first day
of the rest of my life.</i>

212
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,250
<i>An orderly, organized life,
with everything in place.</i>

213
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,208
<i>The dream of a Black girl
who loves justice</i>

214
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>and was born to be a lawyer.</i>

215
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,291
<i>All set.</i>

216
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,125
<i>Time to sleep, to eat,
to wake up, no music, no mess,</i>

217
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,375
<i>no despair, no nostalgia, just will.</i>

218
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,958
<i>The will to speed up even more
and finally be able to say,</i>

219
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:04,000
<i>"Nice to meet you. I'm Anna Júlia,
a lawyer." This is so me, right?</i>

220
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,291
<i>Will you be a singer, daughter?</i>

221
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,500
I love singing with you.
Will you sing one more with me?

222
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,916
Will you?

223
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Will you?

224
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,416
Let's do it.

225
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,791
Beautiful!

226
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,166
Dad, can I borrow your black jacket?

227
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,250
Good morning to you too, honey.
Come have breakfast.

228
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,250
I don't have time. The jacket?

229
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,625
- I gave it away.
- Dad! Not that jacket!

230
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,916
The guy was freezing to death.
I couldn't let him.

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,416
He was alone, abandoned.

232
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
Oh, my God.

233
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,791
- Only you would do that. I'm off to work.
- Okay.

234
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,458
Aninha, what about the coffee?

235
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,375
At least have the milk
I prepared to celebrate yesterday.

236
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,458
Please.

237
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,125
That's it. Listen to your father!

238
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,791
- Okay, Dad. Look.
- As if.

239
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,041
- Yummy.
- There's no napkin.

240
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,250
No, let me do that. You're late.

241
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:22,083
God... I love
when you treat me like a baby!

242
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,750
- Love you.
- Cookie?

243
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,833
I'll take it for the ride.

244
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,041
Anna?

245
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,500
MOM - DON'T ANSWER

246
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,250
Answer it. Deal with it once and for all.

247
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,083
This has already been dealt with.

248
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,875
Anna!

249
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,375
LAW SCHOOL

250
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,791
I don't think you get it, Anna Júlia.

251
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,833
I'd like to know if you'd defend someone
who did something very wrong,

252
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,250
like stealing some old man's pension.

253
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,541
I got it, Heitor. And I've answered you,
but I can slow down so you can understand.

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,750
I wouldn't defend the person
or what they did.

255
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,333
I'd defend
my client's constitutional rights.

256
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,833
The constitutional rights of your client?

257
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,541
You're talking like a lawyer,
and we're just freshman.

258
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,833
- Take it slow, Anna Júlia.
- I'm in a hurry, Heitor.

259
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,583
That's because I'm a woman
ahead of my time.

260
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
<i>My professor and maybe future boss.</i>

261
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,125
<i>Gotta please her, right?</i>

262
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,041
<i>I tried to make it worthwhile</i>

263
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,666
<i>I didn't care about problems</i>

264
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,125
<i>I thought I was enough</i>

265
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,625
<i>But I wasn't for you</i>

266
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,500
<i>I tried to be the perfect guy</i>

267
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,125
<i>I did things your way</i>

268
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,458
<i>I wanted to be more important</i>

269
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,458
<i>But I wasn't for you</i>

270
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,083
<i>It did last, tell me why</i>

271
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,375
<i>You wasted so much time here</i>

272
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,458
<i>I'll do you a favor and vanish</i>

273
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,041
<i>I was just another one for you</i>

274
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,125
<i>I don't know if it was due neediness
Or lack of choice</i>

275
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,750
<i>I just know that I felt love</i>

276
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,166
<i>Too bad, I was the only one who felt love</i>

277
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,333
Sorry.

278
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,625
<i>What do I do with plans
For the coming years?</i>

279
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:35,625
<i>I swear I don't know
I just know I felt love</i>

280
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,875
<i>Too bad, I was the only one who felt love</i>

281
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,375
<i>I was the only one who felt love</i>

282
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,250
Thank you!

283
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,500
- Thanks for saving me that time.
- No problem.

284
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,458
If you need anything, tell me.

285
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,958
- Don't you wanna write a song for me?
- What?

286
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,000
Nothing. I'm kidding. What's your name?

287
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,875
- Wesley.
- Wesley!

288
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,666
- Nice to meet you.
- João Paulo.

289
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,250
We need this case.

290
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,208
- Know anything about these squatters?
- Not yet.

291
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,000
- I know it's nearby.
- I need a connection there.

292
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,333
Sorry, I overheard your conversation...

293
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,416
Hello?

294
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,041
No, I'm not busy. Go on.

295
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,416
I love the scarf! Yes, I'm listening.

296
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:40,583
MORE THAN ONE SQUAT
FEARLESS PEOPLE

297
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,791
- Hey, excuse me.
- Sorry...

298
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,541
We have these food staples

299
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,875
that we deliver to families.

300
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,375
There's a meeting now.
We'll go to the kitchen later to see...

301
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,083
Hey! I'm Anna Júlia, do you remember me?

302
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,833
Guilherme's daughter. The driver.
We talked on the phone.

303
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,500
- I do remember. The working girl.
- Thanks.

304
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,916
Tell me, are you here to volunteer?

305
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
Sure, who do I talk to?

306
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,791
To me. I was one of the first
in this squat.

307
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,708
I can't talk to you right now
because I have a meeting.

308
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,458
- Will you come back later?
- I will!

309
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,541
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Count on me.

310
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,583
<i>Look how everything can change
suddenly in autumn.</i>

311
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,791
<i>Oh, my...</i>

312
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,625
<i>I told you, right?</i>

313
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,083
Oh, no!

314
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,750
I need to go to work!

315
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,375
- Right now?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,541
- And I can't be late.
- But you also can't make the rain stop,

317
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,625
can you?

318
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,958
<i>Oh, rain, come and tell me if I can...</i>

319
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,750
- No!
- I know. It touches deep inside, right?

320
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,666
There's also another rain song I love.
It's by Gil. He is a god.

321
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,916
I have many gods and goddesses too.
Maria Bethânia. Elza Soares...

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,541
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't like music, got it?

323
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,541
- How don't you like music?
- I don't.

324
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,125
No way.
It's like you don't like chocolate,

325
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,583
spooning or the acai berry.

326
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,875
- Impossible.
- You're not making any sense.

327
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:43,041
<i>If I sang you a song by Melodia</i>

328
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,583
<i>You'd follow me like this</i>

329
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,666
<i>Like Cartola and his roses</i>

330
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,416
<i>Wonderful, like Jorge and Gil</i>

331
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,416
<i>And Lady Gaga would migrate</i>

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,291
<i>From her island to our Brazil</i>

333
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,916
<i>Singing a song by IZA</i>

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,375
<i>Or M.I.A. like Caetano in a drumbeat</i>

335
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,625
<i>There's Sabotage and Rita Lee</i>

336
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>Chico Science and Nação Zumbi</i>

337
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,833
<i>And so many people I love</i>

338
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,291
<i>And I don't even sing in this song</i>

339
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,875
They're great artists,
but I don't like music.

340
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,500
I don't believe it. Prove it.

341
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,458
- How?
- I don't know. Sing.

342
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,458
<i>Music makes me cry</i>

343
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,875
<i>I don't know how to sing</i>

344
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,500
<i>It makes me soft, I lose my gaze</i>

345
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,791
<i>Music sticks</i>

346
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,791
<i>Glues in my mind</i>

347
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,708
<i>I get all wrong, I have to study</i>

348
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,125
<i>Music reminds me
Of things I don't wanna see</i>

349
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,625
<i>And it makes me sad</i>

350
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
<i>Sad without knowing</i>

351
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:09,250
<i>Are you gonna say
that a samba doesn't make you happy?</i>

352
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Tell me you don't get excited
listening to Elis?</i>

353
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,250
I've got to go. It's almost time.

354
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,583
<i>Are you gonna say that at the end
of a show you don't ask for an encore?</i>

355
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,500
Stop messing with my head, <i>please!</i>

356
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,041
I don't like music,
but I can't say the same about you.

357
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,958
Where are you going?

358
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,875
We've done business, almost kissed
and you haven't said your name!

359
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,958
Anna Júlia. My name is Anna Júlia.

360
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,875
Anna Júlia?
Your name is a song. Anna Júlia!

361
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:48,083
<i>Those who see you passing by me...
Hey, Anna Júlia!</i>

362
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,291
Wow!

363
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,333
You don't know what just happened!

364
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,625
Excuse me, Sophia!

365
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,541
I really want to talk to you
about this case.

366
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,125
Alexa, what should I do
when an intern candidate

367
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,416
comes to my office all soaked?

368
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,875
<i>Hello, tell her,</i>

369
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,041
<i>"You snooze, you lose."</i>

370
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,833
I'm sorry. I overheard your conversation
about the squat.

371
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,041
I think I can help. I know someone inside.

372
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,250
I want you to talk with your connection
to find out how things work there,

373
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,375
but you must be discreet.
They can't know you work here.

374
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,041
The case is not ours yet. Not officially.

375
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,458
- Can you do this for me, Anna?
- Sure.

376
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,791
I'll deliver the report
as soon as possible.

377
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:44,083
- Great. That's the Anna Júlia we want.
- I won't let you down, Sophia.

378
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,208
I found you!

379
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,333
I made this thinking about you

380
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,833
Spooning Playlist

381
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:14,375
A playlist?
No, you won't convince me.

382
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:22,125
DON'T LET THE NO DISTRACT YOU,
SETTLE IN THE YES, LIKE TIM MAIA'S SONG

383
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,458
- Hey! I'm here!
- Relax. How are you?

384
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,416
You good?

385
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,208
I brought your key
to the room we'll share.

386
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:51,083
- Bed is made, sheets are clean...
- I can't thank you enough.

387
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,583
There's plenty of ways to thank me.
Debit, credit...

388
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,583
- Do I have to pay when I check in?
- When you get there.

389
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,125
But it's okay, right?

390
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,041
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Cool.

391
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,000
- Have a nice day at work.
- Peace.

392
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,125
- I like the laser beam!
- Thanks!

393
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,708
Your scarf was kidnapped

394
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,166
Ransom Lunch with me tomorrow

395
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,833
Scarf for autumn

396
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,708
New rug

397
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:47,250
80's musician headband

398
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,916
Attention, JP, that's enough. Stop it.

399
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,625
This recording is for you to stop tripping
and remember your ideas.

400
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,250
What if I write a song...

401
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,708
about a girl wearing a colorful scarf?

402
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,583
Who doesn't like music or rhymes.

403
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,958
What if I write a song about a girl...

404
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm fixed on the girl idea.
I'm obsessed with her.

405
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,000
I wish I was Lulu. Hit after hit.

406
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:19,250
The true hit maker.
You're gonna be a hit maker, son!

407
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,958
You'll look at the bunkbed
and write a good song... on a bunkbed!

408
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,625
Help me, Lulu!

409
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,916
- Lulu?
- You called me?

410
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,833
- Lulu!
- JP, right? What's up?

411
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,458
How can I write a great song?

412
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:37,833
Have you eaten?

413
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,416
I could eat four of these.

414
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,208
- I use a smartphone app.
- Smartphones make you dumb.

415
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,333
Right?

416
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,333
The voice should be between the mind
and the heart. In the middle.

417
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,625
My mom, Lulu.

418
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,583
She used to say,

419
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,291
"I'll buy it later." These things hurt!

420
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,083
I'd like to be more confident
in front of people.

421
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,000
You know what? Feel it.

422
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,625
- Hold it.
- But let it go.

423
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,250
- Let it go!
- But hold it!

424
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,083
Three, four, two...

425
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:14,458
And the neck is steady. Floating,

426
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:15,541
smiling.

427
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Again!

428
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,916
- JP for posterity.
- Heart to the sky.

429
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,666
Help me, Lulu!

430
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,416
Stop tripping, right, JP?

431
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,750
Hi. Excuse me. Good morning.

432
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:39,583
Good morning, girl!
You came! That's great!

433
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,958
Coming through. Don't forget the salt.

434
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,291
Right on time!

435
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,375
- You'll try my food.
- What an honor!

436
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,625
But help with that pan over there.

437
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,500
Then I'll show you around.

438
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,958
Come on, everyone!

439
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,500
What about our lunch?
I'll meet you.

440
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,333
I can't, João You're a musician

441
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,583
Musicians eat too.

442
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,458
That's why I'm here.
I think the office will take the case.

443
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,666
My boss didn't say much.

444
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,125
They take a lot of <i>pro bono</i> cases,
you know?

445
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,291
<i>- Pro bono?</i>
- When the client doesn't need to pay.

446
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,083
Nice, right?

447
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,958
What about you? What do you do?

448
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,291
I sing.

449
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,875
I know you sing, JP,
but how do you make a living?

450
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:39,000
That's my job. My main one.
Full time! All the time, since forever.

451
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,375
Until I die.

452
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:45,833
I don't believe
what you told me about the festival.

453
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,916
I think you can pull that off.

454
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,000
When we really want something,
we go get it. We focus.

455
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,583
Focus? I don't even know what that means.

456
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,083
Look over there.

457
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,583
I'll teach you.

458
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,083
You need a chart in your head,
like this plate.

459
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:05,750
You split it in sections
and focus on what's most important.

460
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,833
In this case...

461
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,375
the salad.

462
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,791
So, that's it.
I don't care much for lettuce.

463
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:21,541
I don't think anybody does, but we eat it
because we know it's good for our future.

464
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,916
I think life works like a huge hot dog.

465
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,250
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

466
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,166
What?

467
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,291
You may even have a recipe.
All the ingredients too,

468
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,208
- including bacon.
- Bacon?

469
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,500
- Bacon?
- Jeez!

470
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:37,125
You know when you're starving
and would do anything for food?

471
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:41,041
It's dramatic!

472
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,208
You take the hot dog,
and the sausage jumps.

473
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,708
It falls out. The ketchup
stains your only pair of white pants.

474
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,833
- You know?
- Yeah.

475
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,833
It's sad!

476
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,083
And then...

477
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,833
the hot dog...

478
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,458
just flows.

479
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,375
Just like life.

480
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,708
There's no chart. There's no rule

481
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,625
that prepare us for this ride,
Anna Júlia.

482
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,958
Got it?

483
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,958
I have to go work.

484
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,416
Bye.

485
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,791
Bye.

486
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,333
Bye!

487
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,416
Bye!

488
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,500
The administration office.

489
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,916
There's paperwork,
resident documentation...

490
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,958
But I love it here.
This is my vegetable garden.

491
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,791
- Coming through!
- Good morning!

492
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,416
How are you, João?
Could you plant these?

493
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,166
Are you in charge of the administration?

494
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,500
- I take care of everything.
- Mom, Ms. Ida is feeling ill again.

495
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:51,500
Jussara took her to the ER,
but the kitchen is empty.

496
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,625
I can help.

497
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,000
Your father said you were hard-working.

498
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,666
Come on. We have six hands
to cook for 300 people.

499
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,625
I loved lunch

500
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,083
No problem. We can wait.

501
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,500
Sorry!

502
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,708
<i>I</i>

503
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:15,583
<i>Missed you and cried</i>

504
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,291
<i>Today nothing else matters</i>

505
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,416
<i>I'm going through life
On this road of no return</i>

506
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:29,583
<i>I will never give up</i>

507
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:33,916
<i>Listening to my heart</i>

508
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:40,958
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

509
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:45,916
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

510
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:50,666
<i>You have to smile
Each one is more than one</i>

511
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:56,166
<i>You have to cry
You have to say and you have to act</i>

512
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,375
<i>To work</i>

513
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,708
<i>To occupy</i>

514
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,250
<i>To resist</i>

515
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:08,875
<i>To conquer our home</i>

516
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,250
<i>I</i>

517
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,833
<i>Missed you and cried</i>

518
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,500
<i>Today nothing else matters</i>

519
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:26,750
<i>I'm going through life
On this road of no return</i>

520
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>I will never give up</i>

521
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:37,875
<i>Listening to my heart
The drum beats in my chest</i>

522
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:53,041
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

523
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:58,625
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

524
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,541
<i>Here everyone has value</i>

525
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:08,833
<i>Here there is no hurry and no color</i>

526
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:13,250
<i>It has flavor, it has knowledge</i>

527
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,791
<i>To walk</i>

528
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,791
<i>To welcome</i>

529
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:23,291
<i>And to win</i>

530
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,708
<i>I</i>

531
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:35,250
<i>Missed you and cried</i>

532
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,458
<i>Today nothing else matters</i>

533
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:44,458
<i>I'm going through life

534
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:49,791
<i>I will never give up</i>

535
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:55,666
<i>Listening to my heart
The drum beats in my chest</i>

536
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,958
Here is the report for the first day.

537
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,250
Where is the info I requested?

538
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
It's in there.

539
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,458
- I've been there, and it's impressive.
- It's personal info.

540
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,791
I need objective info.
How their structure is,

541
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,458
what problems they're facing. Got it?

542
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,416
- That's not it!
- Right.

543
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,833
The coffee was great. Thanks so much.

544
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,750
- I'll sing. It'll blow your mind!
- Let's do it.

545
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:47,375
<i>The guitar, the case on the ground</i>

546
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,791
<i>There's no money, no</i>

547
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,166
<i>Throw a dime, okay?</i>

548
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,166
- Can I really be honest?
- Okay, mock me.

549
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,416
- You like to mock, go on.
- Keep on trying.

550
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:07,541
Anna?

551
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:08,958
What's all that, Dad?

552
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,916
What?

553
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:14,208
Are you redecorating our house now?

554
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,541
No, it's Rubinho's!

555
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,541
He had an argument
with his wife and got a divorce.

556
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,416
Suddenly, there was
a moving truck outside.

557
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,208
- What could I do? I had to help him!
- Dad!

558
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,583
Baby...

559
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,875
I miss when you were a kid
with those tiny little legs.

560
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:35,000
You didn't look at me like that
back then. You'd make up games.

561
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,250
You'd knock me down, run under the table.

562
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,708
Do you remember the moon picnic?

563
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,625
Oh, my God! Only you would, Guiguis.

564
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,666
Good night.

565
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,583
Can you believe Rubinho has a DVD player?
Who has one these days?

566
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:49,916
Take a look. It still works.

567
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,583
<i>That's how I am without you</i>

568
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,708
I was cute, right?

569
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,500
Cute and noisy!

570
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,708
- Oh, my God! How could you handle this?
- That's parenting. A lot of love!

571
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:07,250
I still remember
when your mom gave you this toy.

572
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,625
You still have it, right?

573
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,541
<i>You'll be with a guy</i>

574
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:17,166
<i>Someone who doesn't love you</i>

575
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,583
<i>It will always be a thorn</i>

576
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,041
<i>Inside my heart</i>

577
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:27,125
- Why are you playing this video now?
- Rubinho left the DVD player here.

578
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,000
<i>Hey, Anna Júlia...</i>

579
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,708
I know...

580
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:36,541
I miss watching you two together.
Singing like mother and daughter.

581
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:43,666
It's time for you to settle this situation
with your mom. Please!

582
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,125
You don't give up, Dad!

583
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,208
- I'm going for a walk.
- But you just got here!

584
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,708
Dad, please, ask your friend
to get rid of all this stuff

585
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,875
because we can't live in this mess!

586
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,958
<i>Hey, Anna Júlia...</i>

587
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,583
<i>Júlia... Júlia...</i>

588
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,625
The chord I played was beautiful.
I liked the melody.

589
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,916
There's a problem though.
I think my lyrics are genius.

590
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,625
Then I think they're nonsense.

591
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm very anxious,
and I've spent a lot of time on it.

592
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,083
Nothing good came out of it.

593
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,041
Just one lame try,

594
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,166
but at least I got something.

595
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,750
- I talk too much, right?
- No, not at all!

596
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,833
I'm just dealing with a lot.

597
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,833
But you replied so quick.
I thought you'd give me a hard time.

598
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,458
I really needed to go out today.

599
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,333
Go anywhere, do anything.

600
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,916
So, I am anything now?

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,916
- Sorry. That's not what I meant.
- Thanks!

602
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,666
I'm just weird.

603
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,708
Totally weird.

604
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,125
Who doesn't like music?

605
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,750
I just wanted
to forget about today, you know?

606
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:06,833
To distract myself.

607
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,250
- Take a look.
- What?

608
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,541
I'm a great distraction.

609
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:05,958
HE'S THE DISTRACTION SHE NEEDED THE MOST
SHE'S THE VERSE HE COULDN'T FIND

610
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:22,625
Are you sure, Babi? You know how hard
it is to get an internship like this.

611
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,583
I'm not sure if I want to work here.

612
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:29,166
I admire people who are aware
of their own limitations.

613
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,333
I'm so young and still have
so much ahead of me.

614
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,583
- Anyway, you get it, right?
- I really don't.

615
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,750
- But good luck!
- You too.

616
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,291
- I'll miss you.
- Take care!

617
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,666
Babi, look on the bright side.

618
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,666
Now that you don't work here anymore,
we can go out on a date.

619
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:50,833
No! Hell no!

620
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,541
That's something
I was never able to admire.

621
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,208
Those who are not aware
of their own limitations.

622
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:58,625
Let's get to work!

623
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,333
LOOKING FOR SONGWRITING PARTNER
Send video

624
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,291
<i>Come, come, I'm going up today
Come, come, today I'm...</i>

625
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:26,458
<i>I really should know</i>

626
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,916
<i>Where have you been</i>

627
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:35,750
<i>I would like to understand</i>

628
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:40,958
<i>Why do I feel so much pleasure</i>

629
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,375
<i>When I'm with you?</i>

630
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:47,458
Of course, man!
We'll write this song together.

631
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,375
Got it? To me,

632
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,625
the choreography is one
of the most important parts

633
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,208
for this festival performance.

634
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:57,750
I was thinking about something like this,
see if you like it.

635
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,458
Like...

636
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,916
Seven, eight and...

637
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,083
Do you think you can follow?

638
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,583
I guess so. I'll have to practice, right?

639
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,541
Heitor?

640
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,208
Your report is great.
That's a good intern job.

641
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,541
- This is just the first.
- Congrats.

642
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,833
Hear that, Anna Júlia?

643
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,000
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

644
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,000
Dear, here's your blanket.

645
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:49,416
- Isabel, how is everything?
- It's okay, Anna Júlia. What can we do?

646
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,416
Last time I was here,
I had some questions.

647
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,291
How do you organize internally?
Is there an election?

648
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,750
We have lots of problems.

649
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:01,041
We brought people
from another building. It flooded.

650
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,583
- The whole place flooded.
- How can I help?

651
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,458
If you can accommodate everyone,
that would be nice.

652
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,541
Jesus, the power is out.

653
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:12,333
We've been facing electrical issues.

654
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:16,625
If we don't get an electrician,
the building could burn with us in it.

655
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,625
Not again, man.

656
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:21,708
Is the problem with the generator?

657
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:32,125
What? Did something different happen?

658
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,416
Let me guess, it was that Heitor guy.

659
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,333
I don't know. It was just a reality check.

660
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,125
Well, to change this reality,

661
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:46,833
- how about listening to music, sing along?
- Dream on, Guiguis!

662
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:47,916
Honey!

663
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,208
Wow!

664
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,750
Our song! Sing along, baby!

665
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,416
<i>I know you like to play</i>

666
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:13,916
<i>Of loving</i>

667
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:20,958
<i>But not with me</i>

668
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,416
<i>Not with me</i>

669
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,583
<i>I also know that you</i>

670
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:33,375
<i>I don't know anything else</i>

671
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:38,000
<i>One day you will</i>

672
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:43,166
<i>Hear from someone</i>

673
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,166
<i>What I heard from you</i>

674
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:52,458
<i>Then we will think</i>

675
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:57,083
<i>How I dreamed in vain</i>

676
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:01,291
<i>Don't go or go</i>

677
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:06,416
<i>You are who you want</i>

678
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,500
<i>You know what?</i>

679
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,625
<i>I love you</i>

680
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:38,166
<i>I also know that you</i>

681
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,875
<i>I don't know anything else</i>

682
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,166
<i>One day you will</i>

683
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:53,250
<i>Hear from someone</i>

684
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:58,958
<i>What I heard from you</i>

685
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:03,375
<i>You know what? I love</i>

686
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:07,375
<i>You know what? I love</i>

687
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:10,750
<i>You know what?</i>

688
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,541
<i>I love</i>

689
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:22,583
<i>You</i>

690
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,208
Mommy!

691
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,333
What?

692
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,541
She's living here now.

693
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,375
Go ahead.

694
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,625
I'll be waiting for you right here.

695
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,000
Dad, don't do this to me.

696
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Please.

697
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,375
Fix this thing.

698
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,541
Well, if not for you...

699
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,416
At least do it for me.

700
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,708
That's a low blow, Guilherme.

701
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,208
You know I'll do anything for you.

702
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:07,666
So, go.

703
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,750
I'm not sure if I can do it, Dad.

704
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,250
- Dad.
- Anna Júlia...

705
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:18,833
Let's get out of here.

706
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,625
I'll leave this place

707
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:23,166
if you promise me

708
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,958
you'll talk to your mom later.

709
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:29,791
Okay, I promise.

710
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,000
Anything.

711
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,333
Let's go.

712
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:50,000
<i>Hi, João. This is Otávio.
I got your phone number on the website.</i>

713
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,750
<i>Dude, I'm really excited
to be in the festival.</i>

714
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:58,125
<i>I've got a deal with a studio. Let's meet
there and get to know each other.</i>

715
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,708
<i>What do you say? Are you in?</i>

716
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,333
- Sophia, I really need to talk to you.
- Say it.

717
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,416
I've got new info about the squat.

718
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:16,041
Their building has electrical issues.
It could catch fire.

719
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,666
- Burst into flames?
- Yes.

720
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,833
- I thought we could do something.
- Write a report about it.

721
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:24,583
That's good info.
That's the kind of info we need.

722
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,125
See you later.

723
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,666
Welcome!

724
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,916
- Oh, my God, man! No!
- Yes!

725
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,583
- No!
- Yes.

726
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:39,166
Oh, my God! Look at this, man!

727
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,458
I feel like I'm in a spaceship!

728
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,000
I died, right?
It's impossible! It's a dream!

729
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:49,250
It's like I'm in a playground just for me!

730
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,375
Jimi Hendrix resurrected,
and he's playing with me.

731
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:53,541
- Jimi?
- Hendrix.

732
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:57,750
- Who?
- Really? A guy that played the guitar.

733
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,416
- Cool.
- Can I take a look?

734
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,791
Sure!

735
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,791
- Man, how did you get that stuff?
- It's my uncle's.

736
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,125
So?

737
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,833
With this production,
our song will come out.

738
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:09,916
- Yes!
- Sure!

739
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:14,083
That's why I brought you here.
So you can record anything you want.

740
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:17,416
Let's record some stuff.
Let's get in this festival.

741
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:22,000
And then, we just have
to surf the social media hype.

742
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,750
You'll enjoy it!

743
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,958
Excuse me. Do you need anything else?

744
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,166
No, you can go.

745
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,916
Okay.

746
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:39,041
Do you want feedback on the job you did?

747
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,166
Yeah.

748
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:43,458
You remind me so much of myself
when I was your age.

749
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:47,250
You wrote a very good report, Anna Júlia.

750
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,958
I feel this position will be yours.

751
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,708
- You must give me more reports like this.
- Sure!

752
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,541
It'll be worth it.

753
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:58,958
Trust me.

754
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:11,458
Tavinho. We're going
to make this song, man.

755
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:15,916
We just need to work on some details.
A little more on the lyrics. I'll do it.

756
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,291
Lyrics? You said lyrics?

757
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,625
I got an idea! Wait!

758
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,750
Stay there!

759
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,333
I've been writing since I was a kid.

760
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,833
I gotta show you my poetry, my rhymes.

761
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:30,708
- I wrote when I was in school.
- There's no need.

762
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,041
You're doing a lot.

763
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:35,625
You're working too much.
Leave the song to me.

764
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,750
We don't do anything alone here.

765
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,000
JP, I'm with you, man.

766
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,375
- Take the opportunity. You're so hot.
- But look...

767
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:46,291
I don't wanna be that hot musician type.

768
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,291
I wanna make real music, man.
I wanna sign up for the festival.

769
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,875
- I wanna touch people's hearts.
- You think you're not?

770
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:57,625
I was the first to feel it.
It tore me up inside, man.

771
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,583
I'm lost. I'm completely crazy about you!

772
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:04,750
Go, Hot Musician! Take a look
around the studio you're in. Hit it!

773
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:16,666
<i>Hi, João. I need to celebrate.
What about a real date number two?</i>

774
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:26,083
The first step of a great celebration

775
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,458
is the power of the hot dog.

776
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,875
Hey, guys, excuse me.
Where's the bus station?

777
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:40,458
- Over there!
- It's over there.

778
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,500
- Okay, thanks. Your hair is so nice!
- Yours too!

779
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,583
Thank you.

780
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,250
Why are we running?

781
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,750
- I don't know. Where are we going?
- I know.

782
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,208
Come!

783
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,541
- You'll like it!
- Music, JP?

784
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:59,166
You'll like it! Give me a chance.

785
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:01,916
Okay.

786
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,916
Let's sing a song. One song!

787
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
- You're kidding me, right?
- No. I'm serious. Just one.

788
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,625
I'll sing alone, then.

789
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,500
Look, I'll sing alone.

790
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,500
Do you have <i>Várias Queixas?</i>

791
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,875
<i>You can do whatever you want</i>

792
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,791
<i>Even hurt me</i>

793
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:36,083
<i>Only love overflows in my heart</i>

794
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:41,166
<i>Since the moment I saw you
I couldn't believe</i>

795
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:46,541
<i>But if I can't, come love me</i>

796
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,625
<i>Several complaints</i>

797
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:51,083
<i>Several complaints from you</i>

798
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,916
<i>Why did you do this to me?</i>

799
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:02,041
<i>We are together and mingled</i>

800
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:07,041
<i>Baby, I want to be your boyfriend</i>

801
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,583
<i>My body shakes
And wants to find your love</i>

802
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:15,291
<i>Olodum's swing takes me</i>

803
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:18,000
<i>With you, I'll go</i>

804
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:24,708
<i>Take me, baby My darling</i>

805
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,416
<i>Take me
That way I'll go crazy for you</i>

806
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:34,875
<i>Take me, baby My darling</i>

807
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:39,500
<i>Take me
That way I'll go crazy for you</i>

808
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,500
<i>Several complaints</i>

809
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,750
<i>Do you dare to love me</i>

810
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:50,125
<i>I wonder, I wonder</i>

811
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,625
<i>Do you have the courage to come</i>

812
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:58,500
<i>I wonder, I wonder</i>

813
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,916
<i>They say I'm too heavy, I'm trouble</i>

814
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,083
<i>I'm mad, that I'm too much for you</i>

815
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:12,625
<i>The real thing is that I'm aware
A Black woman is different</i>

816
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:14,833
<i>I have wounds</i>

817
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,458
<i>But I also want to know</i>

818
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:23,708
<i>How it is to be</i>

819
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,708
<i>With my Black man in peace</i>

820
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:32,750
<i>Oxalá's peace</i>

821
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:36,625
<i>But I also want to know</i>

822
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:40,958
<i>How it is to be</i>

823
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:45,958
<i>With my Black man in peace</i>

824
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:49,333
<i>Oxalá's peace</i>

825
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:54,125
<i>Do not be afraid of me</i>

826
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:57,875
<i>We will rock the world</i>

827
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:02,500
<i>I see your scars</i>

828
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:06,166
<i>You take care of me</i>

829
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:11,250
<i>Do not be afraid of me</i>

830
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,833
<i>Of my long face</i>

831
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:19,083
<i>I just want happy days</i>

832
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:23,666
<i>Me and you and nothing else</i>

833
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,875
<i>Come stay with me
Come stay with me</i>

834
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,041
<i>Come stay with me</i>

835
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:36,833
<i>I just want happy days</i>

836
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:41,250
<i>Me and you and nothing else</i>

837
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:47,250
<i>Come stay with me
Come stay with me</i>

838
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,375
<i>Come stay with me</i>

839
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:54,083
<i>I just want happy days</i>

840
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,666
<i>Me and you and nothing else</i>

841
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,708
Hey, where are you going?

842
00:56:03,416 --> 00:56:04,541
Come here.

843
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,375
You were leaving without a kiss?

844
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:11,458
- Is that it?
- You looked so good sleeping.

845
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:14,666
I didn't wanna wake you up,
but I have to go.

846
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:18,625
I don't have class today.
I can get on with work.

847
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,875
You care so much about working.

848
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,833
You'll understand when you grow up.

849
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:26,166
It's going to get cold,
and I don't have my coat.

850
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:28,375
I can't believe this.

851
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:32,958
A girl with a life planned
until the age of 170 doesn't know

852
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,625
that in autumn in São Paulo

853
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:40,666
you need a coat, a scarf, an umbrella,

854
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,625
and a JP to protect you from the cold too.

855
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,166
I have to go to work.

856
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,625
Talk to you later.

857
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,375
Thanks for the coat, okay?

858
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,708
I'm about to start a meeting
with a new client now.

859
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,041
I need you, okay?

860
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:15,458
Thank you.

861
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,083
- Alexandre, good morning.
- Good morning!

862
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,541
- How are you?
- Fine.

863
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:22,250
Glad you decided to come to our office.

864
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:25,208
Jaime wants to take part in the meeting.

865
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,625
- He won't be long.
- Okay, let's wait.

866
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:35,125
While we wait for Dr. Jaime,

867
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:40,291
I can tell you about the firm.
Cases we've already won...

868
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,666
Good morning, everyone.

869
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,375
- Jaime.
- Sorry, I'm late,

870
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:48,541
- but I think we can get started.
- Good morning!

871
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:54,333
Alexandre, as I've told you, we're totally
capable of defending your case.

872
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,166
This is not our first case like this,
and of all the cases...

873
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,666
And of all the other cases...

874
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,041
Anna Júlia, I think you need
to take care of something outside.

875
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,666
Sorry. Excuse me!

876
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,750
- Hello?
- Hi!

877
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:30,041
Since you've got my phone,

878
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,333
I'm calling to say good morning again.

879
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:34,583
I hung up because I couldn't answer, João!

880
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:37,750
- We can handle this.
- I'm counting on this.

881
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,458
Our CEO is here!

882
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,250
Give it back!

883
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:49,000
Do you want to use all of my minutes?
Come on!

884
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:50,583
Bye!

885
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,458
Let's go ahead.

886
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,291
- Baby, you're here?
- Excuse me.

887
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,166
Keep playing, go on.

888
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:35,750
- You're too slow, man!
- He played hard with me!

889
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:50,916
Hi, Anna.

890
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,750
<i>Hi, João.</i>

891
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:54,833
I want to apologize.

892
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,583
I didn't understand what happened.

893
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,791
I'm sorry, okay?

894
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:03,791
- This job means so much to me.
- Internship, Anna Júlia.

895
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,958
Almost an internship.

896
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,500
I found it very strange
you spoke to me that way.

897
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,458
After our night together.

898
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:15,791
Dad!

899
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:19,208
Just relax. My noisy friends
are just about to leave.

900
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,958
I took care of that matter for you.
I arranged a lunch with your mother.

901
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,625
- You and her.
- You said nothing!

902
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:28,250
Anna Júlia, you promised, remember?

903
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,666
The address and the date are here.

904
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:42,000
<i>- Sorry, João.</i>
- Why the long face?

905
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:45,958
It's my mom.

906
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,125
She left a while ago

907
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,541
- to follow her dreams.
- What kind of dreams?

908
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:54,833
Music.

909
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,208
- Now it all makes sense.
- Look, João...

910
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,375
I called you just to say I'm sorry.

911
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:07,000
Now I need to be alone, okay?

912
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,041
To think a little.

913
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,500
- Okay.
- Talk to you later.

914
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:12,583
Okay.

915
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,666
I need to write a song.
You're getting in the way.

916
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
Bye!

917
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:20,791
Call me.

918
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:22,083
- Okay.
- Okay?

919
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:39,458
Is it me, or are we cooking
more than usual today?

920
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:42,750
There are more people.
Remember the flooded squat?

921
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,416
We had to bring people here,
and they're still here.

922
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:49,333
But that's good, right?

923
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,750
Less on the street,
and more who can help.

924
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,541
Soon they'll need to leave.
The building can't hold everyone.

925
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,791
And we must keep everything legal in here,

926
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,791
- otherwise, we'll get evicted.
- Got it.

927
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:08,791
New report today.
WITH MORE DETAILS.

928
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,958
What if it's about a girl
who doesn't like music

929
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,875
because her mom left home
to pursue her career?

930
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,541
And, ironically,

931
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,291
she falls in love with a musician!

932
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,791
You're focused on that girl.

933
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,416
- Next idea.
- I'm tripping, right?

934
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:25,583
A little.

935
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,625
I gotta focus on writing my song!

936
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,375
- That's it.
- I agree. This is a good one.

937
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,125
- Wes?
- Yes?

938
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,250
- I guess I'll give up the festival.
- No!

939
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:39,750
A hot musician who was born
to shine will give up?

940
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:42,083
- "Hot musician"?
- You don't know?

941
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,708
- What? No.
- Caveman, where are you living?

942
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:51,250
<i>I don't wanna be a hot musician type.</i>

943
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:53,583
Remember the profile Otávio made for you?

944
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:57,583
It has 40 thousand followers, bro.

945
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,666
You can play whatever you want,
wherever you want!

946
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:07,583
And I'll get a luxury suite. Look!

947
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,291
Come on in.

948
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,541
- JP, what's up?
- Hey, Fefito!

949
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,291
- You're looking good!
- Shall we?

950
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,375
Wow!

951
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,208
- Bye, bro!
- Thanks.

952
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,958
Sorry if I was weird yesterday.
I miss you. Let's meet?

953
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:28,666
MORE THAN ONE SQUAT
GRAPHIC

954
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,916
GROWTH
PROPOSALS

955
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,250
Sophia, here.

956
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,541
Here's another report.

957
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,416
- There's pressing information.
- Excuse me, Sophia.

958
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,958
Anna Júlia, there's a weird guy
downstairs looking for you.

959
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:45,083
If I were you, I wouldn't take long.

960
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:48,291
They didn't let him in
because he didn't have an ID.

961
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:50,916
And he's saying that he's your boyfriend.

962
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,250
You may go.

963
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:55,458
- We'll talk later.
- Excuse me.

964
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,458
- Did something happen, JP?
- No.

965
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,708
Everything's fine now.

966
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,083
- I was worried.
- About what?

967
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,958
Nothing. I wanted to see you.

968
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,291
I texted you, but you didn't answer.

969
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:17,875
Come here.

970
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:22,333
Let me explain. This is where I work.
You shouldn't have come here.

971
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:26,333
It's an internship. When it's work,
you won't even want to see me.

972
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:28,625
- For God's sake.
- That way...

973
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,458
You know why I didn't answer?

974
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:32,666
I was working.

975
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:36,750
Do you know what it means?
Do you understand? It's important!

976
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,541
I understand.

977
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:41,833
I understand.

978
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:48,583
Excuse me, Sophia.
Did you read the report?

979
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:50,625
Tomorrow.

980
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,208
Good night.

981
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:08,708
MOM - DON'T ANSWER
CALLING

982
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:34,791
Honey.

983
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,708
When your father called,
I couldn't believe it.

984
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:45,791
Yeah, he insisted that I come,
so I'm here.

985
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,625
Are you hungry?

986
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:51,208
No. I'm not hungry.

987
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:53,208
They serve great steak milanesa here.

988
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:58,000
- I don't like steak milanesa.
- You love it, Anna Júlia!

989
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,708
Some things change over time.

990
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,750
I'm singing at a new place.

991
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:31,708
It would be great if you came to see me.
Can you imagine if we sang together again?

992
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,291
Tell me about your work.

993
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,500
It's cool.

994
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,708
Your father tells me
you're about to get hired.

995
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,625
I guess I am.

996
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,833
Tell me more about your office.

997
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:55,500
I write reports, Pattie.

998
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,208
Nothing you'd be very interested in.

999
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:02,041
I find everything about you interesting,
Anna Júlia.

1000
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,208
I always wanna know how you are.

1001
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,833
Now?

1002
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:08,458
- Now you wanna know?
- Anna, calm down.

1003
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:10,750
I'm just trying to start a conversation.

1004
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:14,541
Come on, Nini, I...

1005
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,583
I miss you so much.

1006
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,375
It's been two years
since you've spoken to me.

1007
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,958
- You didn't miss me when you left.
- I missed you!

1008
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,916
And you still don't get it,
but you will one day.

1009
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,208
My choice wasn't an easy one.

1010
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,208
There wasn't a day
that I didn't think of you.

1011
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,125
That's in the past!

1012
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,333
I'm here now. I'm close to you now.

1013
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:40,750
I... Anna!

1014
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:55,416
<i>I wish I would have told her,
"I really don't understand.</i>

1015
01:07:56,291 --> 01:08:00,791
<i>"I don't have to understand, Pattie.
I'm just a daughter who had no choice.</i>

1016
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:04,750
<i>"You left and I stayed here. In silence.</i>

1017
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:09,125
<i>"Without your voice,
without your laugh, without your music."</i>

1018
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,750
<i>But I said nothing.</i>

1019
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:18,000
WHEN LIFE ASKS YOU TO GROW,
IT'S NO USE TO RUN AWAY, YOU MUST OBEY

1020
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:24,541
Anna!

1021
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:31,875
Everyone, can I have your attention?
I have good news.

1022
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,500
- The meal ticket will be raised?
- No.

1023
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,791
This morning I read Anna Júlia's report

1024
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,666
and decided I don't need any more time.

1025
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:44,791
Here's our new intern!

1026
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,916
Congratulations, Anna!

1027
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,875
You are the newest hire in our office.

1028
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:56,500
Thank you so much.
I promise I won't let you down.

1029
01:08:56,583 --> 01:09:00,083
- I'll be the best intern.
- Congratulations, Anna.

1030
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:03,041
- We have a meeting. Let's go?
- Let's get to work?

1031
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:06,041
Let's go. Sorry it took so long.

1032
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,291
- Congratulations, Anna Júlia!
- Thanks!

1033
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:31,625
- No one goes in or out.
- Hi, guys.

1034
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,166
What happened?

1035
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,291
We received a court order.

1036
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,583
Will you have to leave the building?

1037
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,375
Girl, I just know we'll resist.

1038
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:45,166
Let's go.

1039
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,208
Look, Isabel, I work
in a real estate law office.

1040
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,708
I think they can help.

1041
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,916
Thank you,
but this time the fight will be tough.

1042
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:58,000
The building owner hired
one of the best law firms in town,

1043
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,458
Calixto and Ferreira.

1044
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:04,375
And they have a lot of information.
Someone told them about us.

1045
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:16,708
Hi, honey.
Your mother told me about the lunch.

1046
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,583
Anna Júlia!

1047
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,625
Dad... Please, not today.

1048
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:42,750
I just did something incredibly stupid.
I don't want to talk about it.

1049
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,833
Okay. So, when?
You never want to talk about it.

1050
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:51,333
She abandoned you, Dad!

1051
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,416
She said horrible things!

1052
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,166
Said you were
the most unambitious guy in the world.

1053
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:01,666
- Why do you defend that woman?
- Because that woman is your mother.

1054
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:04,958
Because I'm at peace with myself.

1055
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:11,166
And because I understood
she left me to follow her dreams.

1056
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,833
- And yours too.
- My dreams?

1057
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:14,125
Yes, yours.

1058
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:20,666
How do you think your course was paid for?
It was your mother.

1059
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:24,500
She worked hard,
teaching singing lessons to raise money.

1060
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,416
Got it? She just didn't want me
to tell you.

1061
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:34,458
- How could you betray me like this?
- I betrayed you, Anna Júlia?

1062
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,750
Fine. If you want to behave
like the poor little girl

1063
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:42,875
abandoned by her mother,
which obviously you're not...

1064
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,958
Pattie never stopped reaching out
to you, and you know it.

1065
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:51,250
Wanna keep playing this game? Look at me!

1066
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,291
It's your choice.

1067
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:57,083
I just think it's time for you to grow up.

1068
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:59,625
Come on, open up to your mother!

1069
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:03,250
Be grateful for everything
that woman has done for you!

1070
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,375
Is it really that hard?

1071
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,708
- JP!
- Hi!

1072
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:52,166
- It's me!
- Hi, kid!

1073
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:55,375
I have good news!

1074
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,500
- The festival accepted us.
- We didn't even submit a song.

1075
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,916
You talk like you don't know me at all!

1076
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,375
I sent it to a few producers friends
of mine. They did everything. For free!

1077
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,166
Great song!

1078
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:11,291
<i>I don't know if your talk
interests me...</i>

1079
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,708
A little closer...

1080
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,750
- Enjoy first!
- No, that's...

1081
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:17,708
- Didn't you like it?
- It sucks!

1082
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:19,541
You haven't heard the second part.

1083
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:22,666
You used a song
that's not ours to get us in?

1084
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,333
We gotta use what we have, Hot Musician.

1085
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:27,416
Isn't it your dream to be part of it?

1086
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:30,833
- Can we take a picture?
- It's the Hot Musician!

1087
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:33,708
- He's hotter in person.
- Take a picture for us?

1088
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:35,208
- Sure.
- Yes.

1089
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,041
Want one with me too?

1090
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:40,375
- At least take it with my phone...
- No.

1091
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:47,250
<i>Yes, São Paulo.</i>

1092
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,208
<i>Autumn was coming to an end and look.</i>

1093
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:53,125
<i>Another part of my story.</i>

1094
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:55,625
<i>Looking at everything from up there.</i>

1095
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,791
<i>Now I had a badge to call my own.</i>

1096
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:07,583
<i>But neither autumn
nor my badge solved the doubts I had.</i>

1097
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,125
<i>What's the right thing now?</i>

1098
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:11,750
<i>Smarter, more correct, fairer.</i>

1099
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:16,000
<i>What would be better
in the next chapter?</i>

1100
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,958
Do you really understand
what you're saying?

1101
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,916
I understand, Sophia.
That's what I'm proposing.

1102
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,833
Switch sides! Defend the squat.

1103
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:31,666
They don't deserve to be evicted.
You know it.

1104
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,541
You want me to go against the clients
that pay the office?

1105
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,875
What should I say to our associates?

1106
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,416
Do you remember debating with Heitor?

1107
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:44,375
Defending our client's
constitutional rights.

1108
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,166
The client is Alexandre.

1109
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,791
It's his building! We work for him.

1110
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:49,708
I see...

1111
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:51,958
- Would you like the wine menu?
- Please.

1112
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:58,625
Is there a less full-bodied wine?
Like that one?

1113
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,041
That one came from our chef's menu.

1114
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:03,958
It's in a different wine menu.

1115
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,208
Bring it.

1116
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,250
Are you sure?

1117
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:12,875
I can pay for that wine. Believe me.

1118
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,750
<i>There's nothing better for us to taste</i>

1119
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,375
<i>Than the ugly face when they see me paying</i>

1120
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,833
<i>Bring my wine, kid
If you don't want trouble</i>

1121
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:30,000
<i>My skin is black to match my card</i>

1122
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,000
<i>Nothing comes for free</i>

1123
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:35,208
<i>You need determination
to succeed in life, baby</i>

1124
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,958
<i>That's enough, simplify</i>

1125
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:39,625
<i>Do the right thing without cheating
You know</i>

1126
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:46,791
<i>Yeah, you need to learn</i>

1127
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:55,458
<i>Yeah, you need to learn</i>

1128
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:03,291
<i>Rosé, soufflé, where is the reason</i>

1129
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:05,416
<i>This delirium is a delight</i>

1130
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,208
<i>An embellishment building
Has nothing to do</i>

1131
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:10,583
<i>Attack those who can't fight back</i>

1132
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,125
<i>So there could be you and me</i>

1133
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:15,500
<i>It's really hard to understand you</i>

1134
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,916
<i>How can you pretend not to see</i>

1135
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:20,916
<i>Oh, baby, I'll teach you, come here</i>

1136
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:25,500
<i>Focus on the goal, make a good story</i>

1137
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:30,125
<i>Do whatever it takes
You have to mature to go upstairs</i>

1138
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:34,000
<i>If something messes with your mind
Think about the client</i>

1139
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:35,708
<i>You have to be efficient</i>

1140
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,583
<i>There's nothing indecent
Don't be innocent</i>

1141
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,666
<i>You still live among us</i>

1142
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,500
<i>Every sacrifice is necessary</i>

1143
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:45,541
<i>When the current comes
Better not swim backwards</i>

1144
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,333
<i>Six figures in my salary</i>

1145
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:49,333
<i>Black babe with millions, Bitcoins</i>

1146
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:50,791
<i>Be necessary</i>

1147
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,250
<i>Nothing comes for free</i>

1148
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,750
<i>Only those who have
Determination succeed in life</i>

1149
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:57,125
<i>Do it even if it's a tantrum</i>

1150
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,958
<i>Show the racists the wine in the glass</i>

1151
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:08,000
<i>You need to learn</i>

1152
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,708
<i>You need to learn</i>

1153
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:14,291
Anna, I'm hacking the system from inside.

1154
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:18,083
- Can I count on you?
- Yes.

1155
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,041
You can, Sophia.

1156
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,666
<i>I'll go...</i>

1157
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,833
<i>I'll go to the movie screens, I'll go</i>

1158
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:29,333
<i>Tell my story, I will</i>

1159
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,666
<i>I will</i>

1160
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:38,041
- Did you like it?
- Good. Very good!

1161
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:39,500
I love it, man!

1162
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:43,166
I'm thinking about submitting
this song to the festival.

1163
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,666
- Is it finished?
- No, it's not.

1164
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,208
- But it will be great.
- Then, no. If it's not finished...

1165
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:51,750
We already have one.
Let's stick to that one.

1166
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,291
Excuse me.

1167
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,791
If you're not playing from the heart,
none of this makes sense.

1168
01:17:56,875 --> 01:18:00,583
Sorry to bother you.
This is a good jacket. It's leather!

1169
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:03,583
Here's an amazing hat I got you.

1170
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,666
Let's make a video.
I brought a ring light. Excuse me.

1171
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,125
Go deliver the food before it gets cold.

1172
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:26,958
I forgot the video!

1173
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
Jeez!

1174
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,083
What happened here?

1175
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:37,166
I talked to Rubinho. It wasn't easy,
but he took his stuff.

1176
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,416
He said he'll get the arcade later.

1177
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,583
I realized I was driving you crazy.

1178
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,416
It wasn't just for me, Dad.

1179
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:48,166
It was a bit unfair.
Rubinho was taking advantage of you.

1180
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,250
Rubinho!

1181
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:04,375
I missed that hug!

1182
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:06,875
That's nice.

1183
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:16,833
Wait, Dad.

1184
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:19,250
Moon picnic?

1185
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:24,250
No! That's my favorite game.

1186
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:25,375
You first!

1187
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,708
Merci beaucoup!

1188
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:33,041
Dad, I'd like to apologize.

1189
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,708
For everything, you know.

1190
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:37,125
I know you just wanna make me happy.

1191
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:40,625
Apologies accepted.

1192
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:44,750
And you made me happy for...

1193
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:48,708
twenty-five and a half days
with these snacks I love!

1194
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,708
- Let's go to the moon!
- Let's do it!

1195
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:56,583
Crew, helmets on and...

1196
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:00,916
Let's go! Begin countdown!

1197
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:02,500
Five...

1198
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,250
Four...

1199
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,666
Three...

1200
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,791
Two...

1201
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:09,791
Engines!

1202
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:15,750
I can't believe it!

1203
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:19,291
Gravity!

1204
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:26,500
Oh, my God, zero gravity! No! Watch out!

1205
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:27,583
Watch out!

1206
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:35,416
Why did you come here to tell me all this?

1207
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:38,458
I know what this squat means, Isabel.

1208
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,625
I really thought
the firm wanted to help.

1209
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,041
It won't be possible.

1210
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:47,416
- Sorry.
- Do you want me to forgive you?

1211
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:49,708
For helping to kick us out of here?

1212
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:51,916
No.

1213
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,583
I just wanted you to hear me out.

1214
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:01,583
I get you, Anna Júlia.

1215
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:05,625
You're only doing what's best for you.

1216
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,333
Go ahead.

1217
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:08,958
That's not new for me.

1218
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,250
Excuse me.

1219
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:14,541
There was a time in my life
when the world said

1220
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:18,041
I needed to let go
of a part of myself to be happy.

1221
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,291
And I believed it.

1222
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,875
But in my journey I learned

1223
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,083
that we can be more,

1224
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,458
have more.

1225
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:31,125
That we deserve everything,

1226
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,625
that we can be whoever we want to be.

1227
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,291
This song gives me the strength
to move forward.

1228
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:40,791
And, today,

1229
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:44,708
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very special person.

1230
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:50,166
To someone who is making
my night much happier.

1231
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,083
She is my world.

1232
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:55,625
For her, I am more.

1233
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,958
She's not a little girl anymore.

1234
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:02,625
She is a woman now.

1235
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:04,833
My daughter,

1236
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,000
Anna Júlia.

1237
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,875
I love you so much, Anna Júlia!

1238
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,875
I love you. I admire you!

1239
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,875
I believe in you!

1240
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,250
And, if you let me...

1241
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,041
I'll always be around.

1242
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:22,958
And I know

1243
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,458
that I was never a perfect mother.

1244
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:29,500
And I'll never be.
Because I can only be who I am.

1245
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,208
But I am because of you.

1246
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,500
I'm all yours.

1247
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:40,791
- Alexandre.
- Hi.

1248
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:41,916
- How are you?
- Hi.

1249
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,250
Have a seat.

1250
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:45,458
Thank you.

1251
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:58,750
Shall we?

1252
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:07,791
The Constitution of 1988 provides
that the right to property is guaranteed.

1253
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:13,291
And articles 1228
and 1231 of the Civil Code

1254
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:18,500
emphasize that it's the right of the owner
to use it, enjoy it and dispose of it.

1255
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:22,375
And also to recover it
from whoever obtained it unfairly.

1256
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,041
Guys!

1257
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,750
It's a pleasure to have you here!
Enjoy the festival!

1258
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,541
But the same Constitution also says

1259
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,666
that every property must have
a social function.

1260
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:52,666
In other words, it's an obligation
inherent to the property

1261
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:57,166
that it meets social, public
and not just private demands of the owner.

1262
01:26:57,916 --> 01:27:00,208
That's how justice is, right?

1263
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:04,000
And this property does not serve
any social function.

1264
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,541
I saw the pictures
and videos of that place,

1265
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:09,875
of the abandonment
before the squatters arrived.

1266
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:13,333
It was sad!
It looked like a dump, full of bugs.

1267
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,333
And it also owed property tax.

1268
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:17,333
It's all here in this report.

1269
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,375
- Wes?
- What's up?

1270
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:20,625
Brother!

1271
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:23,916
Which song will you play?

1272
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,375
The one he's ready to play, right?

1273
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,208
Of course! We need to concentrate here.

1274
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:34,625
I'm really nervous,
and he comes here to bother us.

1275
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:38,833
Housing is also a constitutional right.
You can't overlook that.

1276
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:41,916
No one is gonna stop this girl?
Will she keep talking?

1277
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,166
Once, a person I admire a lot

1278
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:48,375
told me that we have to hack the system.
And I believe it.

1279
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:50,125
But I also believe

1280
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:53,583
that we can have the same struggle
and different strategies.

1281
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:57,375
I also want to hack the system,
but by being true to myself,

1282
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,791
doing what I believe,

1283
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,125
with love and confidence!

1284
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:05,333
That's what my mom taught me.

1285
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:08,166
There's no way I can outrun it.
It's inside me.

1286
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:12,916
And that's why I'm grateful
for the time in this office,

1287
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:14,958
but I need to keep going.

1288
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:17,708
And if they take me back,

1289
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:20,583
I'll help defend the squat.

1290
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:26,041
What the hell? What's this?

1291
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:28,208
This is a joke!

1292
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,083
- What a mess.
- Alexandre!

1293
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:32,666
- Since the beginning...
- Alexandre, easy.

1294
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:41,958
<i>The sun even shone that autumn.</i>

1295
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:44,666
<i>Of course I had to defend the squat.</i>

1296
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:48,083
<i>But I still had
to take care of two things.</i>

1297
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:10,166
Hello?

1298
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,416
I need to tell you something.

1299
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:17,000
I realized I'm going to be a great lawyer.

1300
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:24,916
Wanna go to a concert with me?

1301
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,458
And they say
that autumn is always the same.

1302
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:48,041
Wonderful! I'm loving it!

1303
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:49,666
Good luck!

1304
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,666
And now I present you...

1305
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:54,625
João Pedro!

1306
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,708
The Hot Musician.

1307
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,166
João Paulo. Remember?

1308
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:07,791
Never mind.

1309
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,458
JP!

1310
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:51,750
<i>I...</i>

1311
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:59,291
<i>I'll go to the movie screens, I'll go</i>

1312
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:03,750
<i>Tell my story, I will</i>

1313
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:08,833
<i>All my journey, I will</i>

1314
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:10,916
<i>And I am</i>

1315
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:11,958
Happy?

1316
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:15,083
<i>Everything time has done</i>

1317
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:19,416
<i>Much of what it's undone</i>

1318
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:24,208
<i>But I know now it's my turn</i>

1319
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,666
<i>I will</i>

1320
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:31,708
<i>I'll say I got a voice now</i>

1321
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:35,291
<i>The city will hear from me</i>

1322
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:39,958
<i>All that I realized</i>

1323
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:43,625
<i>- I remembered
- I remembered</i>

1324
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:47,375
<i>- The first time I saw you
- I saw you</i>

1325
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:50,125
<i>I got confused</i>

1326
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:54,958
<i>With your power, focus and lucidity</i>

1327
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:56,250
Go!

1328
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:59,250
<i>- You...
- You...</i>

1329
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:03,166
<i>- Changed my world, yeah, it was right here
- Here...</i>

1330
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:06,791
<i>- You're so much more than I expected
- Expected...</i>

1331
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:12,208
<i>- You're the best song I ever heard
- Heard...</i>

1332
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,625
<i>Who knows</i>

1333
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:18,791
<i>- If someone gives you chills, go!
- Go...</i>

1334
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:22,416
<i>- If your philosophies match, go!
- Go...</i>

1335
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:27,791
<i>- If you wanna see them every day, go!
- Go...</i>

1336
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:30,666
<i>- Then go!
- Go...</i>

1337
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:34,333
<i>- If someone gives you chills, go!
- Go!</i>

1338
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:38,250
<i>- If your philosophies match, go!
- Go</i>

1339
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:44,541
<i>- If you wanna see them every day, go!
- Go</i>

1340
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:50,250
<i>I'm in!</i>

1341
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,666
Awesome!

1342
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:15,500
Awesome!

1343
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,458
I didn't want to have to say this,
but the judges decided

1344
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:25,541
to disqualify you
because it's not the song you submitted.

1345
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:29,083
That's okay!

1346
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:32,916
I already have what I wanted the most.

1347
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:37,583
We can achieve anything else!

1348
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:58,291
<i>See how much can happen in autumn?</i>

1349
01:33:58,375 --> 01:34:02,458
<i>To wrap it up perfectly,
there's just one thing that I love!</i>

1350
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,333
<i>Music!</i>

1351
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:09,041
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

1352
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:12,916
<i>Go, the more you understand</i>

1353
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:17,208
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

1354
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,875
<i>Open my heart</i>

1355
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,666
<i>Stick with me, understand</i>

1356
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,541
<i>Homies can't stop dreaming</i>

1357
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:28,458
<i>Life is intense and it's in our mind</i>

1358
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,458
<i>I became fast
So I wouldn't burn myself</i>

1359
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:32,541
<i>Funk has arrived, it's samba and soul</i>

1360
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,125
<i>Our rhyme can't stop</i>

1361
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:36,000
<i>Come forward, stick with us</i>

1362
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:37,625
<i>Let's make Paulista pulse</i>

1363
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:39,333
<i>I follow my brilliance</i>

1364
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,416
<i>Singing, I know how it's done</i>

1365
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:45,083
<i>I feel more alive now and I want more</i>

1366
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:49,416
<i>Today I know who I am
I am the result of this love</i>

1367
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,416
<i>Of the music that invades the chest</i>

1368
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,000
<i>I know that music has set me free</i>

1369
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:59,916
<i>I learned from love
That the world changes this way</i>

1370
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,416
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

1371
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,458
<i>That the world changes this way</i>

1372
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:11,208
<i>Go, the more you understand</i>

1373
01:35:11,916 --> 01:35:14,958
<i>That the world changes this way</i>

1374
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:19,541
<i>And you gotta take care of your heart</i>

1375
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:22,833
<i>Head and brothers</i>

1376
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:27,458
<i>You can't lack justice and passion</i>

1377
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:31,708
<i>I don't doubt it, no</i>

1378
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:36,250
<i>Without saying the direction</i>

1379
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:39,000
<i>I take the song and...</i>

1380
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:40,875
<i>Every now and then</i>

1381
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:46,000
<i>I improvise here and there</i>

1382
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,875
<i>They may even try to control</i>

1383
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:50,791
<i>They may not even understand us</i>

1384
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:54,500
<i>But now they'll have to put up with us
Now they gotta pay to see it</i>

1385
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:58,208
<i>But it's for us not to forget
That we deserve love and power</i>

1386
01:35:58,291 --> 01:36:00,083
<i>We deserve to be able to love</i>

1387
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:02,041
<i>Don't forget, I told you</i>

1388
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:05,583
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

1389
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:09,291
<i>That the world changes this way</i>

1390
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:13,083
<i>Go, the more you understand</i>

1391
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:16,750
<i>That the world changes this way</i>

1392
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:20,458
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

1393
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:23,958
<i>That the world changes this way</i>

1394
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:27,958
<i>Go, the more you understand</i>

1395
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:32,583
<i>That the world changes this way</i>

1396
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,916
An Unforgettable Year AUTUMN

1397
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,750
<i>Tomorrow brings in memory</i>

1398
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:47,291
<i>Our history and one Brazil</i>

1399
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:52,666
<i>That we didn't hear</i>

1400
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:56,500
<i>Who sings to those who created it</i>

1401
01:36:57,625 --> 01:37:03,583
<i>In the light of an unforgettable year</i>

1402
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:13,666
<i>One, two, three...</i>

1403
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:18,625
<i>Sing a lot, sing it loud</i>
<i>Sing it, sing the summer hit</i>

1404
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:23,083
<i>Sing it cause winter is different</i>
<i>It's another season</i>

1405
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:27,500
<i>Sing a lot, sing it loud</i>
<i>Sing it, sing the summer hit</i>

1406
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,250
<i>Sing it 'cause winter is different</i>
<i>It's another season</i>

1407
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:37,916
<i>Go on, so we, the light</i>
<i>The beat, the heart, goes on</i>

1408
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:47,041
<i>Go on, so we, the light</i>
<i>The beat, the heart, goes on</i>

1409
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:52,666
<i>Sing it, scare abandonment</i>

1410
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,458
<i>Paint the town red</i>
<i>Don't let go of my hand</i>

1411
01:37:55,625 --> 01:38:00,166
<i>Sing along, sing and spin</i>
<i>That this spring was autumn</i>

1412
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,958
<i>Sing it, scare abandonment</i>

1413
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:04,666
<i>Paint the town red</i>
<i>Don't let go of my hand</i>

1414
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:09,416
<i>Sing along, sing and spin</i>
<i>That this spring was autumn</i>

1415
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:14,375
<i>Go on, so we, the light</i>
<i>The beat, the heart, goes on</i>

1416
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:27,791
<i>My heart, your heart
