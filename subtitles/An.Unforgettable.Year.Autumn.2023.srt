<i>São Paulo,</i>

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,166
<i>almost 13 million inhabitants.</i>

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>This part of my story began here.
In autumn.</i>

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,708
<i>Sampa in autumn means</i>

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,333
<i>rush, reality, scurrying, umbrella,
coat and sunscreen,</i>

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,791
<i>altogether.</i>

7
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:28,083
<i>The weather changes.
Life's hectic and you've gotta be ready.</i>

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,625
<i>Look at Paulista Avenue.</i>

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,666
<i>Imagine how many dreams
you can find there.</i>

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>For example, this was
my last day of work at a law office.</i>

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,041
<i>It seemed fancy to say this was a job,</i>

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,458
<i>but it was
a college extracurricular activity.</i>

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,250
<i>I dreamt about being an intern there,</i>

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,541
<i>but there's a crowd vying
for the same spot.</i>

15
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,375
<i>A huge, crazy competition.</i>

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,250
<i>Was I sad? A little,</i>

17
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,666
<i>but not discouraged.</i>

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,833
<i>That's me,</i>

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,041
<i>Anna Júlia.</i>

20
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:11,458
<i>I like justice, working, joy.
Not music.</i>

21
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,125
<i>I don't like music.</i>

22
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,958
<i>I didn't want this for my life.</i>

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>On the other hand, I wanted this!</i>

24
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,708
<i>I want to be exactly like them
when I'm older. It's a lot of power.</i>

25
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,833
<i>This is João Paulo,</i>

26
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,750
<i>- a street musician.</i>
- Hey, dude!

27
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>Jeez, he turned my world upside down...</i>

28
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,333
Come on, guys. Let's help!
Put some money in here!

29
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,791
Let's enjoy some music, get to know art.

30
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,625
The Pedros!

31
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>Oh, no. Here comes another fantasy.</i>

32
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,125
<i>Double coffee to wake up</i>

33
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,833
<i>Focus and faith I will succeed</i>

34
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>It's not long before I graduate</i>

35
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,375
<i>So many things, but we're here</i>

36
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,708
<i>And it's written
That the expert will arrive</i>

37
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>It's true, it worked out
The Black woman will be in charge</i>

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,833
<i>I came to sing</i>

39
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,958
<i>My journey</i>

40
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,833
<i>With magic</i>

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,208
<i>Of being who I am</i>

42
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,416
<i>- I have love in my chest
- I have love in my chest</i>

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,291
<i>- And I do it my way

<i>- So I can dawn

46
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,791
Come on, guys!

47
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,583
Good morning.

48
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,666
<i>Go, the more you live the song</i>

00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,291
<i>You know you can't be careless</i>

55
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,458
<i>That this big world comes
And shakes who sleeps</i>

56
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,125
<i>No one can beat me</i>

57
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:11,166
<i>It requires a lot of talent
And direction and luck</i>

58
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,291
<i>- I have love in my chest

00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,458
Wait. I don't like music.

71
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,791
An Unforgettable Year AUTUMN

72
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,583
BASED ON THE WORK OF
BABI DEWET

73
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,416
MOM - DON'T ANSWER

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,375
<i>There's this situation too.
I'll explain it soon.</i>

75
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,000
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Rui.

76
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,833
Thank you.

77
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,375
Excuse me.

78
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,333
Hey, sorry.

79
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,791
- Joice?
- Good morning.

80
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,750
Hi!

81
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,166
Whose stuff is this?

82
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,708
Heitor?

83
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,916
Hey...

84
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,791
Can you move your suitcase, so I can sit?

85
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,541
Unfortunately, I don't have
anywhere to put it.

86
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,125
Go find a chair.

87
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,833
Hey, artist!

88
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,375
Can you stop the noise?
I'm trying to watch the game.

89
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,625
Hey, kid.

90
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,833
Here.

91
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,083
Thanks, Mr. Marcílio.

92
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,250
Listen...

93
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,750
I heard the last band here
had concerts and recorded albums.

94
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,375
The Vultures of the Next Day!

95
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,333
They played at Covers Square
and made a music video that went viral.

96
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,250
Hi.

97
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,333
Came to perform?

98
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,583
In order to play here, you need
to get a pass at the end of the line

99
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,541
- with Baby, who is beside Junk.
- The wonderful Junk!

100
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,791
If you want, come back at dawn.
There's no line nor audience.

101
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,208
But you can play.

102
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
I won't even say a word.

103
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
- Come on! Guys, stay!
- I'm leaving, JP.

104
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,375
Where are you going?
Go get coffee and come back.

105
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,833
I'll wait in line. I'll stay here...

106
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,541
CULTURAL TURN FESTIVAL
ONLY ORIGINAL SONGS

107
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,125
This will be a <i>trend.</i>

108
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,833
Hi, Dad. Did something happen?

109
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,583
Yes. I miss you a lot, kiddo!

110
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,208
And I'd like to know if you want a ride.

111
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,541
I'm driving a nice client
near your office.

112
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,958
<i>- We could celebrate, right?</i>
- There's nothing to celebrate.

113
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,000
But you should, Anna Júlia!

114
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,583
Girl, now you'll have more free time.

115
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,916
Dindinha, tell her.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,083
<i>- Hey, girl! How are you?</i>
- Hi!

117
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,958
<i>Your father told me everything.</i>

118
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,666
Enjoy those young years, girl!

119
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,458
Only you would make me talk
to a passenger.

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,083
- Are you driving? It's dangerous.
<i>- No, baby.</i>

121
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,291
We're stuck in a traffic jam.

122
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,875
I just called
to see if everything is okay.

123
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,416
It will be, Dad.

124
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,500
Since you work nearby,
come by my house later.

125
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,791
<i>- It's in More Than One Squat.</i>
- Thanks. I'll be there.

126
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,958
- Bye, beautiful girl.
- Bye, honey!

127
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,666
- Take care of him.
<i>- Love you.</i>

128
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,625
Bye, guys!

129
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,833
MESSING AROUND
IN THE OFFICE

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,666
Go mess around at home, bye.

131
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,916
Attention, everyone.
I've got news for you.

132
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,583
Well...

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
We lost an intern.

134
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,291
So, I decided to expand
the internship program

135
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,750
to hire one of you to replace him.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,458
This means that this is not the last day
for any of you.

137
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,333
And for those who want
to start a career at this firm,

138
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,666
the good news is...

139
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,208
you have more time to impress me.

140
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,875
- Joice?
- Yes?

141
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,791
- Grab me a cappuccino, please.
- Sure.

142
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,333
No, allow me!

143
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,250
You changed the Wi-Fi password?

144
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,625
What?

145
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,458
Mr. Zé Carlos, I'm a customer today.
It's a cappuccino.

146
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,125
Fancy stuff. Tell me the password.

147
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,958
WI-FI PASSWORD
BUY A CAKE

148
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,250
Empathy! I like you.

149
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,250
Excuse me. Is this the line?

150
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,541
<i>Oh, my God! He's so hot.</i>

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,166
<i>Why did I need just one cappuccino?</i>

152
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,500
Is this a cappuccino?

153
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,458
- Yes, it is.
- Would you sell it to me?

154
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,625
I'll give you the money,
and you give me the goods.

155
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,583
Nice to meet you.
My name is João Paulo. You are?

156
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,416
Thanks.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,166
We did business,
and you didn't tell me your name.

158
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,833
Hey, don't forget it, okay? João Paulo!

159
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,916
In honor of the two Beatles.

160
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,166
- Are you in line?
- No.

161
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,875
DESTINY MAKES YOUR PATH RHYME
WITH MINE

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,666
IT'S LIKE EMICIDA'S VERSE,
WHEN YOU SEE IT, IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

163
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,166
You're fast.

164
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,083
So, pick me.
This internship is all I ever wanted.

165
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,958
- I know.
- I won't let you down.

166
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,208
You must work hard, Anna. Things here
are not easy. You saw the competition.

167
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,583
You must pay attention to everything.

168
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,375
Especially to the details.

169
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,750
Be careful! If you break it,
you need to give me another one.

170
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,208
The stairs! Watch your step.

171
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,250
Hey! Stop it! Excuse me. It won't pass.

172
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,333
- For God's sake.
- Stop complaining.

173
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,291
Excuse me, man!

174
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,916
- Watch the stairs!
- What's going on?

175
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,625
What's this?

176
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,500
Watch the door.

177
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,916
Are we moving and no one told me?

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,333
The band is over, right?

179
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,125
We're moving back to Jaú.

180
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,583
The band is over?
What do you mean, Pedro Jorge?

181
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,500
Excuse me.

182
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,416
- Who decided that?
- I did, right?

183
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,291
We talked about the festival.
It's our chance.

184
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,916
The festival only accepts original songs.
We have none.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,041
But we are good!

186
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,541
We are good,
but have we written anything yet?

187
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,375
- No.
- Right.

188
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,708
- How will we win the festival?
- Relax.

189
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,583
Calm down, <i>brothers.</i>
Isn't that what we are? <i>Brothers!</i>

190
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,791
The Pedros Plus One.

191
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,375
I'm not Pedro!

192
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
But you are my brothers, man.

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Stay!

194
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,166
There's cheese in the fridge.

195
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,458
Is it the mess?

196
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,583
- No.
- I know.

197
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,458
This has nothing to do
with this mess or with you.

198
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,541
- We are the problem.
- Guys.

199
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,541
My mom is in a hurry. Bye, JP!

200
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,958
See you!

201
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,250
The dream is over.

202
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,833
Go ahead!

203
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,583
I'll stay here.

204
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll stay and write a song.

205
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:10,916
You'll see!

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,458
I'm gonna prove to you that one João Paulo

207
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,958
is much more powerful
than three Pedros together!

208
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,708
One!

209
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,791
"THE PEDROS PLUS ONE"
THE BEST COVER BAND IN JAÚ

210
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,166
<i>That day felt like my dream was starting
to become a reality.</i>

211
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,041
<i>As if it was the first day
of the rest of my life.</i>

212
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,250
<i>An orderly, organized life,
with everything in place.</i>

213
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,208
<i>The dream of a Black girl
who loves justice</i>

214
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>and was born to be a lawyer.</i>

215
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,291
<i>All set.</i>

216
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,125
<i>Time to sleep, to eat,
to wake up, no music, no mess,</i>

217
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,375
<i>no despair, no nostalgia, just will.</i>

218
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,958
<i>The will to speed up even more
and finally be able to say,</i>

219
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:04,000
<i>"Nice to meet you. I'm Anna Júlia,
a lawyer." This is so me, right?</i>

220
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,291
<i>Will you be a singer, daughter?</i>

221
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,500
I love singing with you.
Will you sing one more with me?

222
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,916
Will you?

223
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Will you?

224
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,416
Let's do it.

225
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,791
Beautiful!

226
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,166
Dad, can I borrow your black jacket?

227
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,250
Good morning to you too, honey.
Come have breakfast.

228
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,250
I don't have time. The jacket?

229
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,625
- I gave it away.
- Dad! Not that jacket!

230
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,916
The guy was freezing to death.
I couldn't let him.

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,416
He was alone, abandoned.

232
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
Oh, my God.

233
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,791
- Only you would do that. I'm off to work.
- Okay.

234
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,458
Aninha, what about the coffee?

235
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,375
At least have the milk
I prepared to celebrate yesterday.

236
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,458
Please.

237
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,125
That's it. Listen to your father!

238
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,791
- Okay, Dad. Look.
- As if.

239
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,041
- Yummy.
- There's no napkin.

240
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,250
No, let me do that. You're late.

241
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:22,083
God... I love
when you treat me like a baby!

242
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,750
- Love you.
- Cookie?

243
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,833
I'll take it for the ride.

244
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,041
Anna?

245
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,500
MOM - DON'T ANSWER

246
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,250
Answer it. Deal with it once and for all.

247
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,083
This has already been dealt with.

248
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,875
Anna!

249
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,375
LAW SCHOOL

250
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,791
I don't think you get it, Anna Júlia.

251
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,833
I'd like to know if you'd defend someone
who did something very wrong,

252
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,250
like stealing some old man's pension.

253
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,541
I got it, Heitor. And I've answered you,
but I can slow down so you can understand.

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,750
I wouldn't defend the person
or what they did.

255
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,333
I'd defend
my client's constitutional rights.

256
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,833
The constitutional rights of your client?

257
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,541
You're talking like a lawyer,
and we're just freshman.

258
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,833
- Take it slow, Anna Júlia.
- I'm in a hurry, Heitor.

259
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,583
That's because I'm a woman
ahead of my time.

260
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
<i>My professor and maybe future boss.</i>

261
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,125
<i>Gotta please her, right?</i>

262
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,041
<i>I tried to make it worthwhile</i>

263
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,666
<i>I didn't care about problems</i>

264
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,125
<i>I thought I was enough</i>

265
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,625
<i>But I wasn't for you</i>

266
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,500
<i>I tried to be the perfect guy</i>

267
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,125
<i>I did things your way</i>

268
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,458
<i>I wanted to be more important</i>

269
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,458
<i>But I wasn't for you</i>

270
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,083
<i>It did last, tell me why</i>

271
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,375
<i>You wasted so much time here</i>

272
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,458
<i>I'll do you a favor and vanish</i>

273
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,041
<i>I was just another one for you</i>

274
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,125
<i>I don't know if it was due neediness
Or lack of choice</i>

275
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,750
<i>I just know that I felt love</i>

276
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,166
<i>Too bad, I was the only one who felt love</i>

277
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,333
Sorry.

278
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,625
<i>What do I do with plans
For the coming years?</i>

279
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:35,625
<i>I swear I don't know
I just know I felt love</i>

280
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,875
<i>Too bad, I was the only one who felt love</i>

281
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,375
<i>I was the only one who felt love</i>

282
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,250
Thank you!

283
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,500
- Thanks for saving me that time.
- No problem.

284
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,458
If you need anything, tell me.

285
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,958
- Don't you wanna write a song for me?
- What?

286
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,000
Nothing. I'm kidding. What's your name?

287
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,875
- Wesley.
- Wesley!

288
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,666
- Nice to meet you.
- João Paulo.

289
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,250
We need this case.

290
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,208
- Know anything about these squatters?
- Not yet.

291
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,000
- I know it's nearby.
- I need a connection there.

292
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,333
Sorry, I overheard your conversation...

293
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,416
Hello?

294
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,041
No, I'm not busy. Go on.

295
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,416
I love the scarf! Yes, I'm listening.

296
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:40,583
MORE THAN ONE SQUAT
FEARLESS PEOPLE

297
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,791
- Hey, excuse me.
- Sorry...

298
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,541
We have these food staples

299
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,875
that we deliver to families.

300
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,375
There's a meeting now.
We'll go to the kitchen later to see...

301
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,083
Hey! I'm Anna Júlia, do you remember me?

302
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,833
Guilherme's daughter. The driver.
We talked on the phone.

303
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,500
- I do remember. The working girl.
- Thanks.

304
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,916
Tell me, are you here to volunteer?

305
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
Sure, who do I talk to?

306
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,791
To me. I was one of the first
in this squat.

307
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,708
I can't talk to you right now
because I have a meeting.

308
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,458
- Will you come back later?
- I will!

309
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,541
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Count on me.

310
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,583
<i>Look how everything can change
suddenly in autumn.</i>

311
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,791
<i>Oh, my...</i>

312
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,625
<i>I told you, right?</i>

313
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,083
Oh, no!

314
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,750
I need to go to work!

315
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,375
- Right now?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,541
- And I can't be late.
- But you also can't make the rain stop,

317
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,625
can you?

318
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,958
<i>Oh, rain, come and tell me if I can...</i>

319
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,750
- No!
- I know. It touches deep inside, right?

320
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,666
There's also another rain song I love.
It's by Gil. He is a god.

321
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,916
I have many gods and goddesses too.
Maria Bethânia. Elza Soares...

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,541
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't like music, got it?

323
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,541
- How don't you like music?
- I don't.

324
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,125
No way.
It's like you don't like chocolate,

325
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,583
spooning or the acai berry.

326
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,875
- Impossible.
- You're not making any sense.

327
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:43,041
<i>If I sang you a song by Melodia</i>

328
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,583
<i>You'd follow me like this</i>

329
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,666
<i>Like Cartola and his roses</i>

330
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,416
<i>Wonderful, like Jorge and Gil</i>

331
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,416
<i>And Lady Gaga would migrate</i>

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,291
<i>From her island to our Brazil</i>

333
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,916
<i>Singing a song by IZA</i>

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,375
<i>Or M.I.A. like Caetano in a drumbeat</i>

335
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,625
<i>There's Sabotage and Rita Lee</i>

336
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,833
<i>Chico Science and Nação Zumbi</i>

337
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,833
<i>And so many people I love</i>

338
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,291
<i>And I don't even sing in this song</i>

339
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,875
They're great artists,
but I don't like music.

340
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,500
I don't believe it. Prove it.

341
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,458
- How?
- I don't know. Sing.

342
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,458
<i>Music makes me cry</i>

343
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,875
<i>I don't know how to sing</i>

344
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,500
<i>It makes me soft, I lose my gaze</i>

345
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,791
<i>Music sticks</i>

346
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,791
<i>Glues in my mind</i>

347
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,708
<i>I get all wrong, I have to study</i>

348
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,125
<i>Music reminds me
Of things I don't wanna see</i>

349
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,625
<i>And it makes me sad</i>

350
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
<i>Sad without knowing</i>

351
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:09,250
<i>Are you gonna say
that a samba doesn't make you happy?</i>

352
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Tell me you don't get excited
listening to Elis?</i>

353
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,250
I've got to go. It's almost time.

354
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,583
<i>Are you gonna say that at the end
of a show you don't ask for an encore?</i>

355
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,500
Stop messing with my head, <i>please!</i>

356
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,041
I don't like music,
but I can't say the same about you.

357
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,958
Where are you going?

358
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,875
We've done business, almost kissed
and you haven't said your name!

359
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,958
Anna Júlia. My name is Anna Júlia.

360
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,875
Anna Júlia?
Your name is a song. Anna Júlia!

361
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:48,083
<i>Those who see you passing by me...
Hey, Anna Júlia!</i>

362
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,291
Wow!

363
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,333
You don't know what just happened!

364
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,625
Excuse me, Sophia!

365
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,541
I really want to talk to you
about this case.

366
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,125
Alexa, what should I do
when an intern candidate

367
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,416
comes to my office all soaked?

368
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,875
<i>Hello, tell her,</i>

369
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,041
<i>"You snooze, you lose."</i>

370
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,833
I'm sorry. I overheard your conversation
about the squat.

371
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,041
I think I can help. I know someone inside.

372
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,250
I want you to talk with your connection
to find out how things work there,

373
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,375
but you must be discreet.
They can't know you work here.

374
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,041
The case is not ours yet. Not officially.

375
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,458
- Can you do this for me, Anna?
- Sure.

376
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,791
I'll deliver the report
as soon as possible.

377
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:44,083
- Great. That's the Anna Júlia we want.
- I won't let you down, Sophia.

378
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,208
I found you!

379
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,333
I made this thinking about you

380
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,833
Spooning Playlist

381
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:14,375
A playlist?
No, you won't convince me.

382
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:22,125
DON'T LET THE NO DISTRACT YOU,
SETTLE IN THE YES, LIKE TIM MAIA'S SONG

383
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,458
- Hey! I'm here!
- Relax. How are you?

384
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,416
You good?

385
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,208
I brought your key
to the room we'll share.

386
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:51,083
- Bed is made, sheets are clean...
- I can't thank you enough.

387
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,583
There's plenty of ways to thank me.
Debit, credit...

388
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,583
- Do I have to pay when I check in?
- When you get there.

389
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,125
But it's okay, right?

390
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,041
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Cool.

391
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,000
- Have a nice day at work.
- Peace.

392
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,125
- I like the laser beam!
- Thanks!

393
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,708
Your scarf was kidnapped

394
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,166
Ransom Lunch with me tomorrow

395
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,833
Scarf for autumn

396
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,708
New rug

397
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:47,250
80's musician headband

398
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,916
Attention, JP, that's enough. Stop it.

399
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,625
This recording is for you to stop tripping
and remember your ideas.

400
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,250
What if I write a song...

401
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,708
about a girl wearing a colorful scarf?

402
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,583
Who doesn't like music or rhymes.

403
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,958
What if I write a song about a girl...

404
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm fixed on the girl idea.
I'm obsessed with her.

405
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,000
I wish I was Lulu. Hit after hit.

406
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:19,250
The true hit maker.
You're gonna be a hit maker, son!

407
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,958
You'll look at the bunkbed
and write a good song... on a bunkbed!

408
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,625
Help me, Lulu!

409
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,916
- Lulu?
- You called me?

410
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,833
- Lulu!
- JP, right? What's up?

411
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,458
How can I write a great song?

412
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:37,833
Have you eaten?

413
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,416
I could eat four of these.

414
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,208
- I use a smartphone app.
- Smartphones make you dumb.

415
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,333
Right?

416
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,333
The voice should be between the mind
and the heart. In the middle.

417
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,625
My mom, Lulu.

418
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,583
She used to say,

419
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,291
"I'll buy it later." These things hurt!

420
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,083
I'd like to be more confident
in front of people.

421
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,000
You know what? Feel it.

422
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,625
- Hold it.
- But let it go.

423
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,250
- Let it go!
- But hold it!

424
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,083
Three, four, two...

425
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:14,458
And the neck is steady. Floating,

426
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:15,541
smiling.

427
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Again!

428
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,916
- JP for posterity.
- Heart to the sky.

429
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,666
Help me, Lulu!

430
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,416
Stop tripping, right, JP?

431
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,750
Hi. Excuse me. Good morning.

432
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:39,583
Good morning, girl!
You came! That's great!

433
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,958
Coming through. Don't forget the salt.

434
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,291
Right on time!

435
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,375
- You'll try my food.
- What an honor!

436
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,625
But help with that pan over there.

437
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,500
Then I'll show you around.

438
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,958
Come on, everyone!

439
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,500
What about our lunch?
I'll meet you.

440
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,333
I can't, João You're a musician

441
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,583
Musicians eat too.

442
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,458
That's why I'm here.
I think the office will take the case.

443
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,666
My boss didn't say much.

444
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,125
They take a lot of <i>pro bono</i> cases,
you know?

445
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,291
<i>- Pro bono?</i>
- When the client doesn't need to pay.

446
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,083
Nice, right?

447
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,958
What about you? What do you do?

448
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,291
I sing.

449
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,875
I know you sing, JP,
but how do you make a living?

450
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:39,000
That's my job. My main one.
Full time! All the time, since forever.

451
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,375
Until I die.

452
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:45,833
I don't believe
what you told me about the festival.

453
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,916
I think you can pull that off.

454
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,000
When we really want something,
we go get it. We focus.

455
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,583
Focus? I don't even know what that means.

456
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,083
Look over there.

457
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,583
I'll teach you.

458
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,083
You need a chart in your head,
like this plate.

459
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:05,750
You split it in sections
and focus on what's most important.

460
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,833
In this case...

461
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,375
the salad.

462
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,791
So, that's it.
I don't care much for lettuce.

463
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:21,541
I don't think anybody does, but we eat it
because we know it's good for our future.

464
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,916
I think life works like a huge hot dog.

465
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,250
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

466
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,166
What?

467
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,291
You may even have a recipe.
All the ingredients too,

468
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,208
- including bacon.
- Bacon?

469
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,500
- Bacon?
- Jeez!

470
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:37,125
You know when you're starving
and would do anything for food?

471
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:41,041
It's dramatic!

472
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,208
You take the hot dog,
and the sausage jumps.

473
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,708
It falls out. The ketchup
stains your only pair of white pants.

474
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,833
- You know?
- Yeah.

475
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,833
It's sad!

476
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,083
And then...

477
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,833
the hot dog...

478
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,458
just flows.

479
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,375
Just like life.

480
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,708
There's no chart. There's no rule

481
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,625
that prepare us for this ride,
Anna Júlia.

482
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,958
Got it?

483
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:17,958
I have to go work.

484
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,416
Bye.

485
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,791
Bye.

486
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,333
Bye!

487
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,416
Bye!

488
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,500
The administration office.

489
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,916
There's paperwork,
resident documentation...

490
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,958
But I love it here.
This is my vegetable garden.

491
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,791
- Coming through!
- Good morning!

492
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,416
How are you, João?
Could you plant these?

493
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,166
Are you in charge of the administration?

494
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,500
- I take care of everything.
- Mom, Ms. Ida is feeling ill again.

495
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:51,500
Jussara took her to the ER,
but the kitchen is empty.

496
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,625
I can help.

497
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,000
Your father said you were hard-working.

498
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,666
Come on. We have six hands
to cook for 300 people.

499
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,625
I loved lunch

500
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,083
No problem. We can wait.

501
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,500
Sorry!

502
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,708
<i>I</i>

503
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:15,583
<i>Missed you and cried</i>

504
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,291
<i>Today nothing else matters</i>

505
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,416
<i>I'm going through life
On this road of no return</i>

506
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:29,583
<i>I will never give up</i>

507
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:33,916
<i>Listening to my heart</i>

508
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:40,958
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

509
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:45,916
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

510
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:50,666
<i>You have to smile
Each one is more than one</i>

511
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:56,166
<i>You have to cry
You have to say and you have to act</i>

512
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,375
<i>To work</i>

513
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,708
<i>To occupy</i>

514
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,250
<i>To resist</i>

515
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:08,875
<i>To conquer our home</i>

516
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,250
<i>I</i>

517
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,833
<i>Missed you and cried</i>

518
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,500
<i>Today nothing else matters</i>

519
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:26,750
<i>I'm going through life
On this road of no return</i>

520
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>I will never give up</i>

521
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:37,875
<i>Listening to my heart
The drum beats in my chest</i>

522
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:53,041
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

523
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:58,625
<i>Here each one is more than one</i>

524
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,541
<i>Here everyone has value</i>

525
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:08,833
<i>Here there is no hurry and no color</i>

526
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:13,250
<i>It has flavor, it has knowledge</i>

527
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,791
<i>To walk</i>

528
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,791
<i>To welcome</i>

529
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:23,291
<i>And to win</i>

530
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,708
<i>I</i>

531
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:35,250
<i>Missed you and cried</i>

532
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,458
<i>Today nothing else matters</i>

533
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:44,458
<i>I'm going through life
On this road of no return</i>

534
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:49,791
<i>I will never give up</i>

535
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:55,666
<i>Listening to my heart
The drum beats in my chest</i>

536
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,958
Here is the report for the first day.

537
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,250
Where is the info I requested?

538
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
It's in there.

539
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,458
- I've been there, and it's impressive.
- It's personal info.

540
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,791
I need objective info.
How their structure is,

541
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,458
what problems they're facing. Got it?

542
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,416
- That's not it!
- Right.

543
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,833
The coffee was great. Thanks so much.

544
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,750
- I'll sing. It'll blow your mind!
- Let's do it.

545
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:47,375
<i>The guitar, the case on the ground</i>

546
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,791
<i>There's no money, no</i>

547
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,166
<i>Throw a dime, okay?</i>

548
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,166
- Can I really be honest?
- Okay, mock me.

549
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,416
- You like to mock, go on.
- Keep on trying.

550
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:07,541
Anna?

551
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:08,958
What's all that, Dad?

552
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,916
What?
